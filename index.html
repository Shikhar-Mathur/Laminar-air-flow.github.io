                        Laminar air flow is an apparatus consisting of an air blower in the rear side of the chamber which can produce air flow with uniform velocity along parallel flow lines. In this, the air is passed through a HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filter which removes all airborne contamination to maintain sterile condition. It consists of a filter pad; a fan & a HEPA filter (remove particles as small as 0.3nm).

            <li>Initially dust particles are removed from the surface of the Laminar Air Flow with the help of smooth cloth containing alcohol. Switch on the UV light for a period of 30 minutes so as to kill the germs present in the area of washing space..</li> <br>
            <li>The front cover shut off apparatus is opened to keep the desired material inside. The air blower is set at the desired degree so that air inside the chamber is contaminated or may bring contamination. </li> <br> 
            <li>Sit properly in front of the chamber region, wipe the working table with alcohol to reduce the contaminants. All the work related to pouring, plating, streaking etc. are to be carried out in flame zone of burner/ spirit lamp</li> <br>
